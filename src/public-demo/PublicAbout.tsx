          <div>
            <p>
              Meaningful work can go unseen. Causes need people to understand
              their mission, creators need a purpose for their creativity, and
              people who care need a way to take part.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blue Ripple Media brings those people together. We believe
              attention can become a starting point for good: a story sparks
              interest, someone shares or supports it, and the ripple grows.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to help stories about good causes find the audience
              they deserve—and give the people behind them a way to build
              something together.

          contributions include a 10% creator share and stay separate from gifts
          to the cause.
